# Presentation

Well, I created this bot for personal use so it has such specific features and settings, if anyone wants to use it they will need to adapt it a lot to their own PC.

# Installations:

Required Python installations:

**pyautogui** : *py -m pip install pyautogui*

**telebot**   : *python -m pip install --user pyTelegramBotAPI*

# Settings:

- *With the API TOKEN picked up, you will replace the API_KEY in all files with yours*

- *If you want to use the /tokin functionality, you will need to have this BOT, Tokin link: https://github.com/BrandonSaraiva/Projeto-bot-telegram-Lotof-cil*

- **Pyautogui uses the pixels of the screen to move, that's why I talked about this BOT being very specific for my personal use, my monitor is 1920 **

- **You will have to configure some functions for your PC, for example in the /email function it opens the link through my favorites bar in OPERA in a specific position in the favorite, you will have to change the location of pyautogui.moveTo (). In the /drive function it opens the bot in a specific position within the folder. Also remember to leave all applications maximized, if any are smaller than full-scream (browser for example) they will click in another location.**

- *My operating system is windows 10 pro*
